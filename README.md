**HOME QUARANTINING – IDEATHON CHALLENGE**

**What?**

The hackathon is an opportunity to the students of Sona Group of Institutions for both coders and non-coders. We invite nnovators to seek for solutions to tackle the second wave of Covid using range of technologies and with different choice of themes. 
There are two competitions to compete for. One for non-coders and the other for coders. Big prize money of upto Rs. One lakh is awaiting for the winners. The participants will be given certificate of recognition.

**Why?**
The Covid second wave is leashing out our India for the past one month. The cases are in the rising trend and the government is facing problems and challenges in providing proper health care. Many patients with mild symptoms and tested positive for Covid are asked to home quarantine themselves and take proper medical care. Many people are in confused state of how to take care of themselves while home quarantining. If they have a solution that solves their dilemma or confusion on health care, it is a boom for them.

**How?**
The students of Sona group of Institutions (Thiagarajar Polytechnic College, Sona College of Technology and Sona College of Arts and Science) have the opportunity to find solution for the important problem that we face now. The students can form teams with a maximum of four members. The teams can either register for competition 1 or competition 2. They cannot register for both as they are happening at the same time.
